# CUSTOM WM - A dynamic tiling window manager written in C++

# Why ?
* Being a window manager enthusiast and a user, I wanted to learn how they actually worked and how they're written.

# Pros of writing your own WM
* Memory management
* Window management (Obviously)
* Data structures
* Configuration strategies
* It's fun

# Cons
* It's tedious
* Xlib documentation is not well documented
* Time consuming
# Installation
- Libraries required : Xlib
- Programming Language C++ STL

# Configuration
The WM is configured using ini file, which gets parsed at run-time (using my very own [INI parser](https://github.com/dheerajshenoy/iniparser) (not well documented)).
# WM's I took help from
* [BerryWM](https://berrywm.org/)
* [tinyWM](https://github.com/mackstann/tinywm)
* [SimpleWM](https://github.com/kcirick/simplewm)
* [catWM](https://github.com/pyknite/catwm)
* [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/)
