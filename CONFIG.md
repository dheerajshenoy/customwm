# CustomWM Configuration
To see how to configure customWM, please check the config.ini file provided in the repo.
# NOTE
- The section names have to be exactly one of WM, PANEL, CLIENT, PANEL, COLOR, RULES, AUTOSTART, KEYS
- If there are any mistakes in the config, correct it manually (for now), otherwise the WM crashes.

# WM section
* ``MASTER_FACTOR``
